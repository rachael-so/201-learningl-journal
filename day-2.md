# Learning Journal: Day 2

Today I learned about the big overview of things such as Objects, Events, MVC Architecture, etc.

I also started to learn how to use Git and GitHub.  There are a lot of steps and things that I think I will eventually memorize and get a hang of.

A lot of this is new but I will eventually get it!

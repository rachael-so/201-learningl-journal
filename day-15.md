# Learning Journal: Day 15

Today we started our project. I think in this group, communication will be key. We are starting on a make your own story adventure game. I am excited to see how this will turn out. I really hope that this will be a product that we can all be proud of.

We started planning the story but we are far from being down with planning. After planning is all done then I think we will feel more confident about our code.

# Learning Journal: Day 4

Today I did paired-programming with Aaron. Through this, I learned how to communicate my thoughts more effectively by first explaining what I was doing with my code and then explaining how he can fix it as the driver. I also learned more ways to solve the problem given by looking at Aaron's code.

The past week of working with git has helped me use git faster and understand the process a little more. Pushing and pulling makes a lot more sense to me now as well.

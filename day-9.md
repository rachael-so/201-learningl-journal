# Learning Journal: Day 9

The Pat's Salmon Cookie project has taught me a lot so far. Event handling was pretty new to me and I was really confused when I learned it in class, but once I actually did it, it makes a lot of sense.

So far, the logic is tricky, but it's not too bad. With enough time, I can figure out generally what I have to do to solve the problem. I have a hard time figuring out things when I come across a problem, probably because I do not check things while writing my code. I will try to do this more diligently.

Also, CSS is really important but it is hard to figure out. I think it is something that just comes with experience.

# Learing Journal: Day 11

Today we started the bus mall project. This required a lot of thinking and figuring out how things work. I think I did well overall. The hardest part was figuring out the no duplicating situation.

I tried to show the results today on the screen after 25 clicks but I failed. I am waiting to learn how to do this in the upcoming days.

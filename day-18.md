# Learning Journal: Day 18

Today we got our MVP for our project done and started working on our stretch goals. I am feeling pretty good and our project is really coming together.

One worry is that we will try to go too far with our stretch goals and not manage to actually finish any of them. But as things are going now, I think we will be okay because everyone is putting in their best work and effort.

# Learning Journal: Day 6

Today we started this week's project for Pat's Salmon Cookie website. We learned about objects and how to rudimentarily use them. We created 5 objects, which is supposedly inefficient and we will learn tomorrow about using constructor functions. I figured the project out faster than I thought. I am very happy that I understand how to use "this."

I played around with css a little more today. It gives me a headache and I don't understand how it works sometimes. But I kinda got a better hang of RGB colors. It finally clicked that its called RGB because the order of the colors were red, green, and blue.

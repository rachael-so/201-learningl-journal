# Learning Journal: Day 13

Today I did paired-programming with reverend. He was a little behind in the code so it helped me a lot when I explained the code to him.

I learned about local storage today. This was very interesting and easier (at least the amount we learned) to manage than I expected it to be. It did not take that long for me to implement (with paired-programming).

I am excited about project week. I hope that this will be fun and our final project will be super cool.

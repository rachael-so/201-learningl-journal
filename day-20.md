# Learning-Journal: Day 20

Today we finished some stuff on the code and had major git shows and merging conflicts. Isaiah's laptop stopped working so he had to pair up with someone.

We also did a mock presentation for the first time and it was kind of a mess but I am sure it will work out somehow. We have our final product so I am confident about the product itself, but I just hope the presentation goes well and our team can end on a good note with each other as well.

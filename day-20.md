# Learning Journal: Day 20

Today we did our presentations and ended up our time in our 201 class. I am really happy with our final project and I am unexpectedly a little sad about leaving. But overall, this month has been really fun and a cool learning experience.

I really learned a lot and I love the people here at codefellows. For whoever is reading this, thanks for everything!

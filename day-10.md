# Learning Journal: Day 10

Today I worked with Katherine P. to recreate a website that holds the recipe for a chocolate pizza. This was really hard and it took a lot of time but I am really happy with the results. We learned more about using gitHub as well.

Doing formatting first makes a lot of sense I think it works better. Things are more organized and css is not as hard even though it still sucks.
